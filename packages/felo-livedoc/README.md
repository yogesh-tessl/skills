# Felo LiveDoc

Manage knowledge bases (LiveDocs) and their resources via the Felo API.

---

## What It Does

- Create, list, update, and delete knowledge bases (LiveDocs)
- Add resources: text documents, URLs, file uploads
- Semantic retrieval across knowledge base resources
- Route relevant resources by query for targeted retrieval
- Full CRUD for resources within a LiveDoc

**When to use:**
- Building or managing a knowledge base
- Uploading documents or URLs for AI-powered retrieval
- Searching across your knowledge base with natural language
- Routing relevant resources before targeted retrieval

**When NOT to use:**
- General web search (use `felo-search`)
- PPT generation (use `felo-slides`)
